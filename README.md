# My Personal Site

This is a project of my **personal website**, developed like a curriculum/portfolio model.

## Utilized Technologies

- **HTML5**, used as the basis for construction of the page, including tags such as `header`, `main`, `section`and `footer`;
- **CSS3**, including transictions and animations;
- **Javascript (jQuery)**, in order to simulate the parallax effect inside the page banners.
